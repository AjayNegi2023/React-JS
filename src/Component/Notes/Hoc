Higher-order components (HOCs) are a powerful feature of the React library. They allow us to reuse component logic across multiple components.

In React, a higher-order component is a pattern where a function  that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component.

## Benefits of Using Higher-Order Components in React
# Reusability: HOCs allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components, which can save time and reduce code duplication.
# Flexibility: HOCs can take additional arguments, which allows you to customize the behavior of the HOC. This makes them a flexible way to add functionality to your components.

Synatx :
const NewComponent = HOC(OriginalComponent);
-> const CaptainCool = withCaptaincy(Dhoni);

example : 
const HOC = (OriginalComponent) => {
class NewComponent extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1
    }));
  };
