Synthetic Events
The term "synthetic" implies that these events are not directly the native events provided by the browser but are React's abstraction over them. 
Synthetic events in React are cross-browser wrappers around the browserâ€™s original event. Different browsers may have different names for the events. They create a uniform interface that React uses to ensure that events execute consistently across browsers. React normalizes this information to provide a consistent API for handling events regardless of the browser.
