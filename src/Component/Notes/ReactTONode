1) To convert any object to String use JSON.stringify() method
2) HTML default property : whenever we submit a form then page will reload . So use preventDefault() to avoid it 
3) React js Single Page 
4) CORS
5) When we send data using fetch like this  
const response =  await fetch('http://localhost:8080/',{
      method : 'POST',
      body:form
    });
 then fetch try to send the body as it is in our case form is an object so it send as object 
 but in body we need to send data as string so convert the form to string 

 In DEV mode data comes 2 time beacause of Testing Purpose
