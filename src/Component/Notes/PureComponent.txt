PureComponent implements shouldComponentUpdate with shallow comparision with previous props and state to current props and state. if there is no difference then component will not re-render other wise component re-renderd.


Example->
In Parent.jsx we call two component PureComponentReact and RegularComponent
We create a state name 
then change the state at componentDidMount using setInterval. after every 2 second setInterval chnage the name : Aman to Aman 
when we pass the state name to both component as props then PureComponent first render and second time it will not re-renderd. since there is no chnage state bcz previous value is Aman and current value is also Aman.

But in Regular Component it will re- render after every two second because it does implement shouldComponentUpdate() lifeCycle Method.  and it treat state change but state value actually not chnaged.
